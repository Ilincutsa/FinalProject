                        <h3>J.K. Rowling was born on July 31, 1965 in Yate, England and she attended the University of Exeter. She published the first Harry Potter book in 1997 and finished the series in 2007. She published under the name of J.K. Rowling instead of Joanne Rowling due to people being less likely to read if they knew she was a woman writer. Rowling won the Costa Book Award in 1999 for her Harry Potter series and she's still writing today. A few years ago, the Cursed Child screenplay came out where she collaborated with a few other authors to make a book about Harry Potter's child. She also wrote Fantastic Beasts which are currently being made into movies.</h3>
